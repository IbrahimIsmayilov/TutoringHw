# Time Complexity: I am very unsure about this. Since time complexity usually covers the worst case, it would be linear time complexity because all of those 9s in the digits list would eventually become 0 and an additional appending of 0. Therefore, I am guessing O(N) time complexity where N is the length of the digits.
